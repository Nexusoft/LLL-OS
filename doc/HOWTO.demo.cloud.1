HOWTO run the demo social networking application
      using lighttpd and python


# compilation
      
	make sure all required packages are compiled in:
	- lighttpd
	- libtpm
	- python
	- tpmemu


# configuration

	verify that the configuration file has the right IP address
	in data/etc/lighttpd.conf, all fastcgi.server addresses must
	point to the DHCP assigned address of the nexus system, 
	NOT to its localhost (127.0.0.1)

# server

	start lighttpd

		bin/lighttpd -D -f usr/etc/lighttpd.conf

	the -D switch ensures we do not fork into background
	(fork is not supported)


# main python loop

	start python for the non logged-in user

		bin/python usr/var/www/fauxbook/server.py

	NB: networking/nfs is incredibly slow right now. 
	    have patience and wait until the server says it is running
