#### The Fauxbook cloud computing demo

## Requirements

- FatFS: use a vmware/qemu image with disk backend, not .iso + NFS

## Preparations

When using NFS

    1. make sure that the server has set 0666 permissions on
       exported files and directories.


    2. make sure that NFS overwrites .pyc files for which .py 
       files have been updated. Alternatively, remove .pyc and 
       call with python -B (which means, do not generate .pyc)
