### Building on x86_64 architecture

This OS is old-skool, from 2010, so in order for it to build in our initial development stages we need to handle backwards compatible with tie i386 instruction set.
Use the following command to enable the kConfig binaries to execute properly:

```
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386
```

This will install a compatible i386 libstdc to work with the dynamic linking of the internal kconfig binaries included in this source code.
