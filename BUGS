## OPEN

20091210			Networking is slow at around 3Mbps. CPU load is not 100%: find out the blockage
20091207			DNS lookup does not work (at the socket level)
					The resolv.c file in uclibc uses /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf,
					neither of which exists. If we hardcode a bypass, it uses poll(),
					which is also not supported. FIX: get poll working (and add files).
20091203			VMWare player 3.0 cannot boot : does not support any of our VESA modes
20091124			ELF files are occasionally dirty. could be a significant memory issue? (longstanding)

## CLOSED

20091123	20091130	nxlibc_syscall_select does not support network sockets
