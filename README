README:

Welcome to the Nexus operating system! For an overview of
system requirements for booting on bare metal or for executing in a
virtual machine, see the online User Guide at:

       http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/egs/nexus/

Once booted, the system will boot up to a command prompt with multiple
active processes. Use Alt-Tab to scroll through the list of active
processes. For each, the name is displayed in the top-left corner of the
screen:

 - explorer.app is the first application you will see. This is a
   user-level shell that will let you browse the filesystem and start
   additional tasks from /bin. Enter 'help' for the list of commands.

 - kernel is an in-kernel console showing system information.

Don't hesitate to send questions and bug reports. The online contact
page has the addresses.

Enjoy!
