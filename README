Welcome to the Nexus Operating System (LLL-OS)! Once booted, the system will boot up to a command prompt with multiple active processes. Use Alt-Tab to scroll through the list of active
processes. For each, the name is displayed in the top-left corner of the
screen:

 - explorer.app is the first application you will see. This is a
   user-level shell that will let you browse the filesystem and start
   additional tasks from /bin. Enter 'help' for the list of commands.

 - kernel is an in-kernel shell for system configuration tasks, such
   as taking ownership of the TPM or running diagnostics. Again, 'help'
   list available commands.
