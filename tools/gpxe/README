GPXE network bootloader for Nexus


-- Overview ----

GPXE is the new name for Etherboot (which we used before). 
This build process customizes GPXE 0.9.7 to 

1) configure a network device, 
2) retrieve a nexus kernel and initrd environment over the network (TFTP) and 
3) chain load that image.


-- Install ----

Call `make` to generate a set of three GPXE images:

* nexus-gpxe.bzimage 	can be started like a Linux kernel, e.g., from grub
* nexus-gpxe.iso 	can be started as a bootable CD
* nexus-gpxe.usb	can be started as a bootable USB key image


-- Customize ----

It specializes two variables to your configuration: 

* the IP address of the TFTP server.
    By default it uses `hostname -i` to learn this. 
    Set environment variable GPXE_SERVER to override its default.

* the network interface ID. 
    Default is the equivalent of eth0.
    Set environment variable GPXE_NIC to override this.
