Sample kernel for illustrating grub2 + multiboot capabilities

How-to:

1. Install grub2 (1.98) using bin/grub-install compiled under tools/grub2
2. make extracts mbkern/ and the following creates kernel image ``kernel'':
2.1 ``make video'' makes a kernel that draws graphics (1024x768x24)
2.2 ``make initrd'' makes a kernel that prints out init ramdisk contents
3. Move mbkern/kernel and /nexus/build/boot/isoroot/initrd.tar under the boot partition (your-root) grub2 was installed under
4. Use mbkern/grub.cfg for grub2, and change ``set root=(your-root)'' (put it under (your-root)/boot/grub)
5. Boot grub2 and the sample kernel should run
