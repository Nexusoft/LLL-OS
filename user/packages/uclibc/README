## Threading

Nexus has its own pthread implementation, but reuses the libc headers. To
make this work, we compile libc with pthreads (so that the headers will be
installed) but do not link against libpthread.a

To have compilation succeed, all structures must contain their original
fields. We can extend the structures if needed: this is done for mutexes.
