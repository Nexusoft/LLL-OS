Building Python for Nexus

## Download

Because Python is large, we do not include the source in the distribution,
but download it at build.


## Patch stability

The current patch has been verified to work with Ubuntu 9.10: gcc 4.4.1.
Because we partly rely on ./configure to discover system settings, it 
is not impossible that the patch will fail to apply to systems with other
compilers. 

## Double compilation

When the base library and interpreter have been compiled, Python switches to
compiling the standard library items in Lib/. When cross compiling python
for Nexus, this step fails. 

To have both a python for development and for installation, we build the
interpreter twice.

The Makefile dependencies are a bit weird to ensure that hostpython does in
not depend on python. Otherwise, the host gets rebuild each time you issue
a 'make distclean' in python, for instance. And this is really irritating
during debugging.
