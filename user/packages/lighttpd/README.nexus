Lighttpd Nexus port

Compilation is straightforward apart from

1) the server compiles its own parser generator (lemon) from source. Since 
   we compile lighttpd for a different target, but the parser generator has
   to work on the development host, we split compilation in two phases.

2) the patchfile works around a few minor issues:
   - we hardcode use of select(..) for blocking, otherwise SIGIO is selected
   - even on a static system, the dynamic loader header dlfn...h is expected
   - nexus does not yet implement madvise, but ./configure finds it: disabled

3) lighty wants to dynamically load its modules. We force it to statically 
   link the ones we need. See also

## Patch versions

There are two versions of the Nexus patch:

- nexus.patch is faster, running lighty with non-blocking I/O and handling 
  multiple connections in parallel. This version was unstable on last testing.

- nexus.patch-blocking is slower, running lighty with blocking and I/O and 
  therefore having to serialize connections. This version proved stable.

Choose between the preferred version by modifying the `patch -p1 < PATCHFILE'
line in the Makefile
