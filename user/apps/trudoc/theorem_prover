want to prove
  generic.compliance says generic_okay(doc)
we know
  generic speaksfor generic.compliance 
  generic says pol speaksfor generic.compliance
do we know generic.compliance? no
do we know someone who speaks for generic.compliance? implicitly, generic and pol
will pol say anything related to doc? no
will generic say anything related to doc? yes
  generic says docbook_okay(doc') imp generic_okay(doc)
crunch 
  generic.compliance says docbook_okay(doc') imp generic_okay(doc)
new goal: try to get generic.compliance says docbook_okay(doc')
will generic say anything related to doc'? no
will pol say anything related to doc'? yes

seek P says X
strategy 1: find P, ask and learn X
strategy 2: find P, ask and learn Y imp X; seek P says Y
strategy 3: seek Q s.t. Q sfor P; seek Q says X

seek Q s.t. Q sfor P.S
strategy 1: seek P says Q sfor P.S 

seek vector sv, evidence vector ev
sv = { target }
ev = { }

learn stuff:
 find all reps for every spkr for which we seek a statement
 ask all they know (; for each f in f1...fn
  ev += f;
  while change: change = update_sv && update_ev

ev_changed
  for each new elt f in ev:
    if (f is of the form (P says Y imp X) and we are seeking (P says X) then
      sv += P says Y
    if (f is of the form (P says Q sfor P.S) and we are seeking (P.S says X) then
      sv += Q says X

sv_changed:
  for each new elt s in sv:
    if s is of the form (P says X) and we have (P says Y imp X) then
      sv += P says Y
    if s is of the form (P.S says X) and we have (P says Q sfor P.S) then
      sv += Q says X
  
if ever (ev intersect sv is non zero) then done
