## Directory layout

net/			networked apps
    lwip/		netapps that directly talk to lwip
test/			unittests
simple/			single sourcefile apps
attic/			unsupported and deprecated files

# simple
Directory 'simple' holds all applications that consist of a single file and 
have no dependencies besides the standard libs (libnexus ...). 

The build system compiles these in a standard way. To add an application,
create the file in simple and add its base name to the DEFAULT_APPS
target in the Makefile.

# test
Directory 'test' holds a basic testset (U/C)

# *
All other directories hold applications that combine multiple source files,
depend on external files or both. These have individual targets in the
makefile, which are subsequently called from apps: (as are DEFAULT_APPS).

# attic
Anything here is stale. Bitrot has set in.
