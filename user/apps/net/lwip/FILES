These files are taken from the lwIP contrib package.

	http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/contrib/?root=lwip

The initial import was from CVS on November 16th, 2009.
Changes to the files are mostly limited to a main() loop

WARNING: the lwIP interface is not as easy as uclibc:sockets, 
	 especially not in combination with the nexus port. Unless
	 you have a very good reason, you should not code your
	 application in this way.
